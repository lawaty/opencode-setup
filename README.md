# LaCode

> Ultimate opencode setup for Go users

LaCode is an opencode plugin. It routes delegated work onto a weighted pool of
cheap models instead of the expensive one, reaps subagents that hang without
telling anyone, keeps a maintained map of your repository so agents stop
exploring it cold on every task, and tells you when a parallel session finishes
or is waiting on you — including sessions running on remote hosts over SSH,
where the desktop notification would otherwise die on a machine that has no
desktop.

Install it with one config line. It adds agents and commands it finds missing,
and it never overwrites one you already defined.

## Why

| Capability | The problem it solves |
| --- | --- |
| Weighted model pool | An expensive main model burns through its quota doing file listing. |
| Per-model cooldowns and failover | A provider rate-limits mid-session and the whole thing hard-fails, while other providers sit idle. |
| Hang reaper | A wedged subagent holds its slot forever, so the session stalls with no error and no timeout. |
| Desktop notifications | With several sessions open you cannot see which one finished, or which is blocked on a question. |
| SSH notification tunnel | Work on a remote host raises its notification on that host, which has no desktop. |
| Repository context map | Every task starts by exploring your codebase cold, and every agent re-discovers the same layout, the same entry points and the same boundaries — paid for again on every run. |

## Install

```bash
npm i -g @lawaty/lacode
```

Then add the plugin to your opencode config:

```json
{ "plugin": ["@lawaty/lacode"] }
```

Restart opencode. Nothing here hot-reloads: without a restart the config change
does not take effect and the agent set will look stale for no visible reason.

## Configuration

Plugin options are a tuple — the package name, then an options object. Every
option is optional:

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": [
    ["@lawaty/lacode", {
      "enabled": true,
      "models": {
        "slots": [
          { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "weight": 2 },
          { "model": "opencode/big-pickle", "weight": 1 }
        ]
      }
    }]
  ]
}
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | The single off switch. `false` injects nothing at all and does no writes. |
| `models` | — | An inline slot list. Highest-priority source. |
| `modelsFile` | — | An explicit slot file; short-circuits the chain below. |
| `reapMs` | `30000` | Hang-reaper interval. |

### Pool preset resolution

The slot list is the first of these that yields usable slots:

1. plugin options — `models` in the tuple above
2. `~/.config/lacode/pool.json` (its parent directory is created for you)
3. the bundled `presets/free-tier.json`
4. a built-in fallback, so routing always works

A missing, unreadable or structurally broken source falls through to the next and
logs one warning; nothing here throws into opencode. Nothing hot-reloads —
change a preset, then restart every opencode process.

**Any model list is accepted, including paid ones** (US-7). There is no free-tier
allowlist anywhere in the package; only the structure is validated. The bundled
preset happens to be built from free models because that is a sensible default,
not because the pool requires it.

**Installation merges, it does not clobber** (US-16). An agent, command or
instruction is added only when that key is absent from your config. A
user-defined agent of the same name is left byte-identical — not patched, not
partially merged. Skips are counted and logged once.

**`enabled: false` turns all of it off** (US-17). No pool model rewriting, no
agent injection, no command injection, no reaper timer armed, no
`~/.config/lacode` directory created.

These three are specified in [docs/USER-STORIES.md](docs/USER-STORIES.md) as
US-7, US-16 and US-17, and each has tests.

## Context map

Agents are stateless between tasks, and exploring your repository is the most
expensive part of any task — so every agent pays for it again, re-deriving the
same layout, entry points and boundaries from scratch. LaCode keeps a short,
maintained map of the repository in `.opencode/context/` (five files:
`architecture`, `contexts`, `conventions`, `workflows`, `decisions`) and injects
a standing rule that every agent reads the relevant file before exploring and
starts from the canonical entry points it lists. The map holds conclusions, not
inventories: it answers "what should I look at first?" and nothing else, which
is what makes reading it cheaper than the exploration it replaces.

It keeps itself current. When a session that edited code goes idle, LaCode
starts a `context-manager` run that borrows a slot from the same pool every
other subagent uses and updates the map from the changed paths and their
architectural neighbourhood — defaulting to *no edit*, since a changed file is
not a changed fact. Only that one agent ever writes the map; everything else
reports what belongs in it, so concurrent sessions cannot contradict each other.
You can also drive it by hand, which is the move when you do not trust what you
are reading:

```bash
/context-init      # build the map, or verify and refresh an existing one
/context-update    # incremental refresh; accepts a focus, e.g. /context-update src/payments
/context-review    # audit it for staleness, contradictions, duplication and bloat
```

The map is local and untracked — it describes your checkout on your machine, so
it is not committed and not synced. If it is missing, agents check, find
nothing and carry on as before. What this buys is tokens not spent
re-discovering structure; as with everything else here, no savings percentage is
published, because none has been independently measured. The mechanism, the
permission rule that makes one writer possible, and what the log lines mean are
in [docs/CONTEXT.md](docs/CONTEXT.md).

## Cost

The mechanism is specific and small: bulk exploration, implementation and
repository cartography run on pooled cheap or free subagents instead of the main
model, so the main model's tokens are spent on design work rather than on grep.
Agents start from the maintained context map above rather than exploring cold, so
the structure of your codebase is written down once instead of re-derived on
every task. Load is counted per model across every agent type and every process,
so a slot cannot hide behind its own dedicated model while another idles, and a
model that just rate-limited one project is skipped by all of them.

**No savings percentage is published here, because none has been independently
measured.** What the mechanism is worth in money depends entirely on the token
mix of your tasks and on the models you compare the pooled run against. A figure
from someone else's workload is not a claim about yours.

The harness exists so you can produce your own number:

```bash
npm run benchmark          # offline simulation from the pinned price snapshot
npm run benchmark -- --real   # runs both sides for real and reads back the tokens
```

Both print tokens and cost for the same scenario run two ways, and both refuse
to emit a number they cannot derive — an unpriced model reports `unknown`, never
`0`. How the two modes differ is in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md),
which explains the harness and deliberately contains no results.

## Remote hosts

Notifications raised on a remote host need a way back to your desktop. The
reverse SSH forward is what carries them:

```bash
lacode notify "build finished" "4 files changed"      # local desktop, or forwarded if remote
lacode doctor                                        # what the environment resolves to
```

`lacode notify` is fire-and-forget and always exits 0 — an unreachable desktop
must never be able to fail the process that tried to notify you. `lacode forward
HOST -- COMMAND` runs a command on another host over ssh and exits with its
status.

Configuration, the payload format, the receiver contract and holding the forward
open are in [docs/TUNNEL.md](docs/TUNNEL.md).

## User stories

Twenty-two stories across seven epics, each written as a behavioural contract
with acceptance criteria a test can assert mechanically — the pains behind them,
the Given/When/Then criteria, and the story-to-test mapping are in
[docs/USER-STORIES.md](docs/USER-STORIES.md).

## Development

```bash
npm test              # node --test tests/ — offline, no network, no running server
npm run benchmark     # the cost harness; see docs/BENCHMARKS.md
```

Node ≥ 22.18.

`tests/stories/` holds the story suites and `tests/stories/coverage.test.mjs`
is the guard: it reads the `### US-N:` headings out of `docs/USER-STORIES.md`
and the `[US-N]` markers out of the test names and fails if they disagree, in
either direction. **A test that covers a story must have the id at the start of
its name** — `test("[US-7] a paid model is accepted")` — or CI's guard fails it.
A story with no test is as much a failure as a test naming a story that does not
exist.
