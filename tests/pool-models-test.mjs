// presets/free-tier.json is the one file a user edits to change which models the pool
// runs, and what share of the work each one takes. This suite drives the config
// hook against temporary copies of that file and against the real opencode.jsonc,
// proving:
//
//   1. the shipped file parses, and its slots are distinct models with valid weights
//   2. the config hook rewrites every variant agent's model from the file, so
//      opencode.jsonc can disagree and still lose
//   3. a model absent from a provider whitelist is whitelisted automatically,
//      since opencode deletes every model a provider offers that is not
//   4. a missing or broken file degrades to the built-in defaults with a warning
//      instead of a pool that cannot route
//   5. slot count is data, not code: three slots route 1,2,3 and the fourth agent
//      name is simply absent
//   6. weight is a ceiling and a priority: the heaviest slot fills to its own weight
//      before the next slot starts, a bad weight warns and keeps the slot, and the
//      pre-weight `tier` spelling still maps to the weight it used to imply
//   7. the pool is capped at pool.MAX_SLOTS, because opencode.jsonc declares one
//      variant per base per slot and a bigger pool would route to nothing
