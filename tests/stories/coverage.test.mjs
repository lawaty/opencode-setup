// The coverage guard.
//
// This file is the enforcement mechanism behind "tests cover all stories". Every
// other suite can rot quietly; this one cannot, because it compares the STORIES
// to the TESTS rather than trusting either of them:
//
//   docs/USER-STORIES.md   defines  -> every `### US-N:` heading is a contract
//   tests/stories/*.test.mjs  covers  -> every `[US-N]` marker is a test case
//
// Two directions, because each catches a different rot:
//   * a story in the doc with no test  -> a contract that is not verified
//   * a test naming a story not in the doc -> renumbering drift, where tests
//     kept the old id and now silently certify a different story (or none)
//
// It prints the coverage table so the mapping is auditable at a glance, and it
// is the reason "all 17 are covered" stays true as the doc changes.

/**
 * Strip comments, and mask the BODY of every string, template and regex literal.
 *
 * All three are needed, and getting any of them wrong makes the guard lie:
 *
 *   * Without comment stripping, `// test("[US-15] …")` still matches, so
 *     commenting out a test leaves its story looking covered.
 *   * Without string masking, a string that merely *mentions* a test call —
 *     including one inside this file's own fixtures — is counted as a real
 *     declaration.
 *   * Without regex masking, a regex literal as ordinary as `/["'`]/` feeds a
 *     stray quote to the string scanner and desyncs it from there on. The
 *     symptom that exposed this was a false FAILURE (every test after the regex
 *     read as absent), but the same desync is worse in the other direction: it
 *     can *reveal* a `test("[US-N] …")` that lives inside a template or comment
 *     body, inventing coverage for a story no test declares.
 *
 * Each hole was found by trying to break the guard rather than by reading it.
 *
 * The masked copy keeps every index aligned with the plain copy, so a match
 * found in the masked text can be read verbatim out of the plain one.
 *
 * Telling a regex literal from a division operator is the hard part, because
 * both begin with `/`. The rule used here is the one every JS lexer uses: a `/`
 * opens a regex unless the previous significant token ended an expression — an
 * identifier/number (except a few keywords), a string/template/regex, or `)`/`]`.
 * That is enough because a regex is only ever legal where an expression may
 * begin, and everything else (`=`, `(`, `,`, `:`, `;`, `{`, `}`, operators, …)
 * allows one.
