// Shared scaffolding for the story suites.
//
// Deliberately NOT a test file: it defines no `test()`, so `node --test` globs
// `*.test.mjs` only and this file is never run as a suite.
//
// What lives here is the machinery every epic needs, so each epic file stays a
// list of Given/When/Then rather than a pile of boilerplate:
//
//   * a stub `PluginInput` that records every app log line and answers
//     `session.get` from a table the test controls
//   * a fake clock. Every timeout in this package (cooldowns, claim TTL, hang
//     reaping) is `Date.now()`-derived, so overriding `Date.now` is the only
//     seam needed to test hours of pool behaviour in microseconds.
//   * a fresh claim directory per pool instance, so suites never see each
//     other's state and never touch ~/.local/share
//
// Nothing here reaches the network, spawns a real model, or sleeps for a wall
// clock second longer than it must.
