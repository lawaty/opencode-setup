// Epic G — Context and cost.
//
//   US-19  a curated map replaces cold exploration
//   US-20  the map stays current without being asked
//   US-21  one writer keeps the map coherent
//   US-22  on-demand map operations: /context-init, /context-update, /context-review
//
// The feature under test is the codemap at `.opencode/context/`: five files, one
// writing agent, an automatic refresh, and three slash commands.
//
// Two things are asserted here that no other suite asserts, and both are worth
// saying out loud because they are the parts that silently rot:
//
//   * US-20 drives `contextAutoUpdateHooks` — the real hook factory — with a stub
//     client, a temp project root and a temp HOME. Nothing spawns a model, but
//     every decision the plugin makes (bootstrap vs update, which paths count,
//     which slots get borrowed, whether a run actually changed anything) is the
//     one it would make in a live session. That is the only honest way to test a
//     plugin whose whole job is to fire something off asynchronously.
//   * US-21 evaluates the INJECTED permission table the way opencode evaluates it
//     rather than asserting that the strings are present. A rule can contain the
//     right text and still never match, which is exactly how this map went stale
//     for three days in production (see src/lib/writer-rule.ts).
