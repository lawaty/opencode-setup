// /repo/.opencode/context/architecture.md is logged and evaluated as
// ".opencode/context/architecture.md". Patterns compile to anchored regexes (* -> .*)
// and the LONGEST match wins, so neither form covers every project on its own:
//
//   ".opencode/context/**"    fires for a normally-rooted project, but not when the
//                             project root is "/" (the form is then home/.../...)
//   "*/.opencode/context/**"  fires only when the project root is "/"
//
// So the rule to check is whichever form applies to THIS project's root. Checking the
// absolute path instead is what let commit 6f6af0a "fix" a working rule into a silently
// broken one. Reproduced here so a malformed rule is reported at startup instead of
// discovered weeks later as a silently stale map.
//
// The rule has two directions and only checking one is how a map ends up with two
// writers:
//
//   1. the cartographer can write it      (checked here, and reported the way it always was)
//   2. nothing else can write it         (checked here, per agent, by evaluating each
//                                         agent's own winning rule — not by looking for
//                                         the word "allow" anywhere in its table)
//
// Only `edit` is evaluated in direction 2, because that is the only key opencode
// consults: its tool-permission lookup folds the tool names "write" and "apply_patch"
// onto "edit", so a `write` key in a permission block is never read. The `write` blocks
// LaCode still emits are therefore decorative, kept identical to their `edit` twin so
// nobody has to re-derive that folding to know what the rule really says.
