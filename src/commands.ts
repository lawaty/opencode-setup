If \`.opencode/context/\` already exists, do NOT start over — verify and refresh
it in place (correct stale entries, fill gaps) using the review procedure in
your system prompt.

Otherwise follow the bootstrap procedure in your system prompt: progressive
exploration (README → existing docs → manifests → top-level structure → build
and framework config → entry points → selective source), then write the five
context files inside their size targets.

Remember: write conclusions, not inventories. Link to the project's existing
documentation instead of duplicating it.

anything that contradicts the code or existing docs.`,

Focus: $ARGUMENTS

If no focus was given, establish the recent work yourself (git status, git
diff, git log) and start from those changed files plus their immediate
architectural neighborhood.

Follow the incremental-update procedure in your system prompt: update a
context file only if this work introduced or revealed information that will
materially help future agents — a new boundary or module, a new or moved
canonical entry point, a changed workflow, a new convention, an architectural
decision, a new dependency between subsystems, a renamed or moved subsystem,
or a previously undocumented invariant.

Do not edit documentation just because source files changed. No
timestamp-only edits. If nothing material changed, make no edits and report
"no update needed".`,

Everything outside \`.opencode/context/\` is read-only for this run. Do not
modify source code under any circumstances.

Audit the five context files for:

- stale information — verify claims against the actual code
- contradictions between context files, or between the map and the code
- excessive size — consolidate toward the per-file targets in your system
  prompt
- duplicated information — one canonical place per fact; link to the
  project's own docs rather than restating them
- missing canonical entry points for significant subsystems
- unsupported assumptions — anything stated as fact that you cannot verify,
  or that lacks a confidence marker

Fix what you find in \`.opencode/context/\` only, then report: findings, fixes,
and anything you could not verify.`,

export const STANDING_INSTRUCTION = `## Repository context map

This project may keep a navigation map in \`.opencode/context/\`. Before broad
exploration, check whether it exists (\`ls .opencode/context\` — never the \`glob\`
tool, which skips hidden directories). If it does, read only the file relevant to
the task — architecture.md, contexts.md, conventions.md, workflows.md,
decisions.md — then start from the canonical entry points it lists.

Source code is authoritative: if the map disagrees with the code, trust the code,
say so, and never edit source to match the map. Never edit \`.opencode/context/\`
yourself — the context-manager agent owns it. Say in your final report if your
work revealed something that belongs in the map.`
