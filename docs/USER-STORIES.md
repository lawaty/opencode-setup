# LaCode — User Stories

> Ultimate opencode setup for Go users

Every story below is a behavioural contract, not a feature wish. Each one is
traceable to a pain point the author actually hit, and each carries acceptance
criteria written so that a test can assert them mechanically. Phase 3 fills in
the test file for each row of the Coverage table.

**Reading the criteria.** Every criterion is written as *Given … When … Then …
* so that it maps to one test case. "Given" is a state or fixture, "When" is a
single action (usually a hook invocation or a script run), "Then" is an
observable result — a routing decision, a file on disk, an exit status, a log
line. Criteria that cannot be observed without a running server are not in this
document; everything here is testable offline with a stub client and a
`mkdtempSync` state directory.

**Terminology.** A *slot* is one entry in `presets/free-tier.json`, carrying a
model and a `weight`. A *base* is a pooled agent type (`explore-fast`), and its slot
holders are `<base>-<slot>`, hidden in `opencode.jsonc`. A *claim* is a running
spawn recorded in `claims.<pid>.json`. A *context map* is the five-file
`.opencode/context/` codemap described in Epic G.

## Epics and the pains behind them

| Epic | Pain point it solves |
| --- | --- |
| **A — Cost control** | Quota exhaustion. Routine work (grep, reading, cartography) was consuming the same expensive budget as design work, and the main model was being spent on file listing. |
| **B — Provider resilience** | Provider limits. Free-tier quotas are per-provider and per-minute, so a long session would hard-fail the moment one provider's window closed, even while three other providers sat idle. |
| **C — Hang recovery** | Hangs. A wedged or silently-stalled subagent held its slot forever; one bad task stalled the session with no error and no timeout. |
| **D — Notifications** | Parallel sessions. With several sessions open, work finishing — or a question blocking — was invisible unless you happened to be looking at that terminal. |
| **E — Remote hosts** | Remote SSH notification. Work ran on remote hosts, so notifications raised there died on that host's nonexistent desktop instead of reaching the local one. |
| **F — Adoption and safety** | Installability. A personal config cannot be adopted safely: it either clobbers what you already have, or needs manual surgery before it runs. |
| **G — Context and cost** | Cold exploration. Every task started by re-discovering the structure of the codebase from scratch, so the same layout was re-read — and re-paid for — on every single run. |

## Epic A — Cost control (route bulk work off the expensive model)

### US-1: Bulk exploration runs on cheap/free subagents
**As an** opencode user paying per token, **I want** file reading and searching delegated to cheap subagents, **so that** my main model's budget goes to design work instead of grep.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-1
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the root agent `build` with read/glob/grep denied, When a read-family tool is invoked, Then the call is denied and the agent is pointed at an exploration base rather than executing inline.
- [ ] Given a pooled base such as `explore-fast` is spawned, When the plugin rewrites the spawn, Then the concrete model selected is a slot declared in `presets/free-tier.json`.
- [ ] Given a pool whose slots are all zero-cost, When N exploration spawns run, Then none of them is dispatched to a paid model.

### US-2: One knob selects the exploration/implementation model
**As a** user, **I want** to change which model handles delegated work without editing prompts, **so that** I can change cost strategy in one place.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-2
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the pool preset is edited to swap a slot's model, When a pooled spawn is routed, Then the new model is used with no change to any agent prompt in `opencode.jsonc`.
- [ ] Given `opencode.jsonc` hard-codes a model for a pooled agent, When the plugin boots, Then it warns that the hard-coded value is overridden and that `presets/free-tier.json` wins.
- [ ] Given a slot declares an invalid `weight`, When the pool loads, Then it falls back to weight 1 and warns, rather than dropping the slot.

### US-3: Reproducible cost benchmark
**As a** maintainer, **I want** a script that measures the token/cost of a representative task with and without the pool, **so that** any savings claim is measured rather than asserted.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-3
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the benchmark script is run against a fixed task prompt, When it executes, Then it reports token counts and cost for the pooled run and the unpooled run from the same input.
- [ ] Given a slot's model is free, When the benchmark prices it, Then its cost is 0 rather than unknown or omitted.
- [ ] Given the benchmark runs with no network access, When it cannot reach a pricing source, Then it fails loudly instead of reporting 0 cost for a paid model.

### US-23: Pool models are for mechanical work, so free is the policy
**As a** user, **I want** the shipped pool to be free models doing mechanical work, **so that** the tokens I am actually trying to save — the main model's — are not spent on reading files.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-23

This is the policy behind US-1 and it does not contradict US-7. The pool exists to take **mechanical** work — reading, searching, mechanical edits, cartography — off the main model, so the shipped slots are free. Free is the default and the documented policy; **supplying a paid model remains a supported, deliberate override**, which is why nothing here rejects one. The reconciliation is that acceptance and endorsement are different claims: the pool accepts anything, and the preset states what it is for.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the bundled preset, When its slots are priced against the pinned models.dev snapshot, Then every slot is free or very cheap, and any slot the snapshot cannot price is named as unknown rather than assumed to be free.
- [ ] Given a configured slot model the pinned snapshot prices above zero, When the plugin boots, Then it warns once, says that a priced model in a pool for mechanical work likely costs more than it saves, and names the model — and the warning never appears twice.
- [ ] Given a configured slot model the snapshot has no price for, When the plugin boots, Then it says nothing, because an unknown price is not evidence of an expensive one and this project refuses to guess prices.
- [ ] Given the price snapshot is absent entirely, When the advisory runs, Then it is a no-op rather than an error, and plugin startup is unaffected.
- [ ] Given a priced model is configured in the pool, When a spawn is routed, Then it is routed to that model exactly as before: the advisory reports and never blocks, because rejecting it would break US-7.

---

## Epic B — Provider resilience (weighted model pool)

### US-4: Automatic failover when a provider rate-limits
**As a** user on free tiers that hit per-provider limits, **I want** subagents to move to a different provider automatically, **so that** long sessions do not fail.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-4
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a spawn fails with a rate-limit-shaped error, When the error is serialized and matched, Then the offending model is marked cooling and a cooldown file is written for it.
- [ ] Given model A is cooling, When the next spawn is routed, Then the pick is a different model and the spawn is never refused outright.
- [ ] Given every model is cooling, When a spawn is routed, Then the least-loaded slot is chosen anyway (degrade, never block).
- [ ] Given a limit error names a reset time, When the cooldown is recorded, Then the stated reset is used instead of a guessed backoff.

### US-5: Weighted preference drains preferred providers first
**As a** user, **I want** to express preference between models via weights, **so that** the pool prefers the cheapest/freest provider up to its ceiling.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-5
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a heavy slot and a light slot, When spawns are routed below both ceilings, Then the heavier slot is filled before the lighter one.
- [ ] Given a slot is at its weight ceiling, When another spawn is routed, Then the pick moves to the next slot under its ceiling.
- [ ] Given every slot is at its ceiling, When another spawn is routed, Then it goes to the least-loaded slot as overflow.
- [ ] Given all slots carry equal weight, When spawns are routed, Then the picks round-robin in declaration order.
- [ ] Given per-slot load is read, When it is asserted, Then a slot's load never exceeds its weight ceiling except by overflow.

### US-6: Live pool visibility
**As a** user, **I want** to see per-slot load and which model is cooling and why, **so that** I understand where my subagents are going.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-6
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given claims are held by several processes, When the status view is requested, Then it shows every process's claims and the aggregate load per slot.
- [ ] Given a model is cooling with a stated reason, When the status view is requested, Then the model is listed as cooling together with that reason.
- [ ] Given a claim file is older than the dead-file threshold, When the status view is computed, Then the stale claim is pruned rather than counted.
- [ ] Given a slot is at its ceiling, When the status view is requested, Then it is marked as the slot the next spawn would take.

### US-7: Non-free models still work
**As a** user who wants a paid model in the pool, **I want** to supply any model list, **so that** the pool is not restricted to free tiers.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-7
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a slot names a paid model, When the pool loads, Then the slot is accepted and routed to without a free-tier filter rejecting it.
- [ ] Given a model id contains a vendor prefix with slashes (e.g. `openrouter/nvidia/model:free`), When it is split into provider and model id, Then the split is on the first slash only and the id tail is preserved.
- [ ] Given more slots are declared than the pool allows, When the pool loads, Then the surplus entries are dropped with a warning naming the cap.

---

## Epic C — Hang detection and auto-recovery

### US-8: Wedged subagent is detected and aborted
**As a** user with many parallel sessions, **I want** a silent or stuck subagent killed automatically, **so that** one bad task cannot stall my session forever.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-8
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a claim has exceeded its TTL and produced no recent activity, When the reaper sweeps, Then that claim's process is aborted.
- [ ] Given the reaper is idle, When its timer interval elapses, Then a sweep runs on its own, and a sweep also runs on the next pooled spawn without waiting for the timer.
- [ ] Given a claim is young and active, When the reaper sweeps, Then it is left alone.
- [ ] Given a claim is swept, When the sweep completes, Then the total reaped count increases and a greppable log line names the reaped claim.

### US-9: Capacity recovers without restart
**As a** user, **I want** the aborted slot returned to the pool, **so that** throughput returns without restarting opencode.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-9
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a claim is reaped, When the next routing decision is made, Then the freed capacity is available and is not still counted as in use.
- [ ] Given a claim file's owning process is gone, When claims are read, Then the file is pruned as dead and its capacity returned.
- [ ] Given an orphaned temporary claim file exists, When claims are read, Then the orphan is cleaned up rather than counted.
- [ ] Given a reaper sweep empties the backlog, When routing resumes, Then no manual intervention or restart is required.

### US-10: Hangs are surfaced, not silent
**As a** user, **I want** to know a hang happened and was reaped, **so that** I can investigate rather than wonder why an agent vanished.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-10
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a claim is reaped, When the reaper reports, Then the log names the reaped session and the reason (hung past TTL with no activity).
- [ ] Given the reaper is armed, When it starts, Then a single greppable line records that it is armed and on what interval.
- [ ] Given a reaper sweep fails internally, When the sweep is reported, Then the failure is reported through the app log and never thrown out of the hook.

---

## Epic D — Notifications for parallel sessions

### US-11: Notification when a session finishes
**As a** user running many parallel sessions, **I want** a desktop notification when a session goes idle or errors, **so that** I can work elsewhere and know when to return.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-11
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a session went busy and is now idle, When the idle event fires, Then a `done` notification is delivered.
- [ ] Given a session errors, When the error event fires, Then an `error` notification is delivered and it bypasses the duplicate-suppression cooldown.
- [ ] Given a session that never went busy, When it goes idle, Then no notification is sent.
- [ ] Given a subagent session or a cartographer session, When it goes idle, Then it is suppressed.
- [ ] Given the notify helper exits non-zero or writes to stderr, When the result is evaluated, Then the delivery is reported as failed rather than sent.

### US-12: Notification when a question is asked
**As a** user, **I want** to be notified when opencode is blocked waiting on my input, **so that** a pending prompt is never silently blocking a session.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-12
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a question is asked, When the event fires, Then a `question` notification is delivered that includes the question's text.
- [ ] Given a session has a parked question, When the idle event that follows fires, Then no duplicate "finished" notification is sent.
- [ ] Given a parked question is replied to, rejected, or the session errors, When that event fires, Then the pending entry is cleared and the next real completion notifies again.
- [ ] Given a question and a completion occur inside the same cooldown window, When both are evaluated, Then they are not deduplicated against each other.

---

## Epic E — Remote hosts over SSH

### US-13: Notification reaches the local desktop from a remote host
**As a** user working on a remote machine over SSH, **I want** notifications from remote sessions delivered to my local desktop, **so that** remote work still notifies me.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-13
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a notification is raised on a remote host, When it is delivered, Then the local desktop shows it.
- [ ] Given the remote host has no desktop session of its own, When the notification is delivered, Then the username and bus path come from the local-user marker, never from the remote `id -u`/`id -un`.
- [ ] Given the notification travels to the forced-command receiver, When it arrives, Then its urgency and icon are validated against a whitelist before `notify-send` is invoked.
- [ ] Given the notification is sent, When it crosses the hop, Then it is passed as a single self-delimiting argument and never interpolated into a shell string (see US-18 for why it cannot be four).
- [ ] Given the session outlives the terminal it was started from, When the tunnel's original owner disconnects, Then notifications still arrive because the tunnel is a supervised unit rather than a login side effect.

### US-14: Tunnel degrades safely
**As a** user, **I want** the tunnel to fail silently when unreachable rather than blocking or erroring, **so that** a flaky connection never breaks my session.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-14
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the remote host is unreachable, When a notification is attempted, Then it fails without blocking or throwing out of the hook.
- [ ] Given the notification helper is missing, When the plugin looks for it, Then it warns once and continues working.
- [ ] Given the sync script runs many ssh calls while a tunnel is live, When each call is made, Then forwardings are cleared on that call so it does not compete for the tunnel port.
- [ ] Given a notification arrives at the receiver with an argument that is not whitelisted, When it is validated, Then it is rejected rather than forwarded to `notify-send`.

### US-18: Notification content survives the SSH hop intact
**As a** user on a remote host, **I want** the notification's text to arrive on my local desktop whole, **so that** a hop which fails quietly is not also a hop that delivers nothing.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-18
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the notification crosses the hop, When it is passed, Then it is one newline-delimited argument, because ssh concatenates everything after the host into a single command string and starts the forced command with no positional parameters.
- [ ] Given the forced command is started, When the payload arrives, Then it is read from `$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` and never from `$1`–`$4`, which are always empty over ssh.
- [ ] Given a body containing spaces, punctuation or glob characters, When it arrives at `notify-send`, Then it is byte-identical to what the remote sent.
- [ ] Given a payload containing shell metacharacters (`$(…)`, backticks, `;`, `&&`) or extra fields, When the receiver handles it, Then it is parsed as data only: nothing is executed and the argument list passed to `notify-send` is unchanged.
- [ ] Given a payload that cannot be understood at all, When it arrives, Then the receiver still exits 0 and pops up what it received, rather than failing the hop.

---

## Epic F — Adoption and safety

### US-15: One-line install with sane defaults
**As a** new user, **I want** installing LaCode to require one config line and no manual setup, **so that** I get value immediately.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-15
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a fresh machine with no LaCode config, When the install runs, Then one config line is sufficient and no further manual step is required.
- [ ] Given no configuration is present at all, When LaCode boots, Then it falls back to shipped defaults and still functions.
- [ ] Given the plugin package is installed, When its peer dependency is unmet, Then the requirement is declared rather than silently duplicated inside the package.

### US-16: Merges, never clobbers
**As a** user with an existing opencode config, **I want** LaCode to add its agents/commands only where absent and never overwrite my own definitions, **so that** installing it cannot break my setup.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-16
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given an agent of the same name already exists in the user's config, When LaCode merges, Then the user's definition is left untouched.
- [ ] Given a command of the same name already exists, When LaCode merges, Then the user's definition is left untouched.
- [ ] Given a merge adds an agent, When it is written back, Then every pre-existing key in the file survives the round trip unchanged.
- [ ] Given merging runs twice in a row, When the second run completes, Then the result is identical to the first (idempotent).

### US-17: Single off switch
**As a** user, **I want** one option to disable LaCode's config injection entirely, **so that** I can recover instantly if something misbehaves.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-17
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the off switch is set, When LaCode boots, Then no agent, command, or rule is injected into the user's config.
- [ ] Given the off switch is set, When the bootstrap runs, Then it makes no writes at all.
- [ ] Given the off switch is unset, When LaCode boots, Then injection behaves exactly as before — disabling is the only behavioural difference.

---

## Epic G — Context and cost (a maintained map instead of cold exploration)

The pain: every task opened by exploring the repository from scratch. The same
directory layout, the same entry points and the same layering were rediscovered
— and re-paid for — on every run, and nothing written down survived the session
that learned it. LaCode keeps a five-file codemap at `.opencode/context/` and
makes agents read it before they explore, then keeps it current on its own.

### US-19: Curated map replaces cold exploration
**As a** user, **I want** agents to start from a maintained map of the codebase, **so that** each task spends fewer tokens on re-discovering structure that is already written down.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-19
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a config that defines none of LaCode's agents, When the config hook runs, Then a `context-manager` subagent is injected, and it carries no model of its own, because the pool is the only thing that decides which model runs it.
- [ ] Given the injected agent set, When the slot variants are built, Then a hidden `context-manager-<slot>` variant exists for every slot the pool can hand out, so a cartography run borrows shared capacity instead of a dedicated model.
- [ ] Given a user config with no `instructions` array, When the config hook runs, Then the standing context-map rule is injected, naming all five map files, telling the agent to check with `ls` and never the `glob` tool, to read only the file relevant to the task, and to start from the canonical entry points the map lists.
- [ ] Given the injected `context-manager`, When its prompt is inspected, Then it names the five files it owns, requires a short "Start here" list of canonical files per significant subsystem, and forbids file inventories — the map answers "what should I look at first?", never "tell me everything".

### US-20: The map stays current without being asked
**As a** user, **I want** the map refreshed automatically after a session that edited code, **so that** agents are never misled by stale documentation.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-20
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a file inside the project was edited, When the root session next goes idle, Then a `context-manager` session is created and prompted with the edited paths listed, rather than nothing happening.
- [ ] Given `.opencode/context/` does not exist, When the automatic run fires, Then it is told to bootstrap the map; given that the directory exists, Then it is told to make an incremental update.
- [ ] Given an idle event with no pending edit, or one from a subagent session, or one following an edit inside the map itself or inside a build directory, Then no cartographer is spawned.
- [ ] Given an automatic run borrowed a pool slot, When it completes, Then the slot is released and the cartographer session going idle does not spawn a second run.
- [ ] Given an automatic run that changed nothing on disk, When it reports, Then it says the map was not changed rather than reporting success, so a cartographer that was blocked from writing is distinguishable from one that had nothing to do.
- [ ] Given an automatic run that failed, When it reports, Then the paths it was given are queued again, so a failed run does not strand the work.

### US-21: One writer keeps the map coherent
**As a** user, **I want** exactly one agent allowed to write the map, **so that** concurrent sessions cannot fight over it or produce contradictory versions.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-21

Enforcement is split deliberately, and the split matters: **what the permission table enforces** is that `context-manager` can write the map and that *no other agent can*; **what the prompt enforces** is that every other agent knows to report map-relevant findings instead of making them. The permission half is the load-bearing one — it holds regardless of what the model decides to do — but it cannot tell an agent what it *should* have done, so the instruction is not redundant and is not going away.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given the injected agent set, When every agent's `edit` permission is evaluated against a path inside `.opencode/context/`, Then `context-manager` is the only agent whose winning rule for that path is `allow`, and every agent that may otherwise write files carries a `deny` on both spellings of the map path — so the map is closed to non-cartographers by permission, not only by instruction.
- [ ] Given an agent's `edit` rules are evaluated the way opencode evaluates them, When the narrow map `deny` is declared before a broad `"*": "allow"`, Then the broad rule wins and the agent is reported as a second writer; so the deny is required to be the LAST entry, and the shipped table must be declared in that order.
- [ ] Given the `context-manager` permission rule, When it is evaluated for a normally-rooted project and for a project rooted at `/`, Then both spellings of the map path are allowed, because opencode evaluates file permissions relative to the project root.
- [ ] Given a config whose one-writer rule allows neither spelling, When the writer rule is verified, Then it reports which rules it saw, that the map is not writable, and that both forms are required — instead of leaving a map that silently never updates.
- [ ] Given a config in which a non-cartographer agent would be granted the map, When the writer rule is verified, Then it reports that agent by name together with the rule that wins for it, and the report is silent once the deny is narrowed and placed last.
- [ ] Given an agent other than `context-manager` finishes work, When the standing rule reaches it, Then it is told never to edit the map itself and to report what belongs in it instead, so that a denied agent knows what to do rather than only that it was refused.
- [ ] Given `edit` is denied for the map, When the same agents read the map, Then reading is unaffected: the rule narrows the `edit` tool only, so the map stays readable by exactly the agents that are told to check it.

### US-22: On-demand map operations
**As a** user, **I want** `/context-init`, `/context-update` and `/context-review`, **so that** I can bootstrap, refresh, or audit the map whenever I don't trust it.

**Story ID(s) for tests:** US-22
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Given a config that defines none of LaCode's commands, When the config hook runs, Then `/context-init`, `/context-update` and `/context-review` are injected, each targeting `context-manager` as a subtask.
- [ ] Given an injected command template, When opencode substitutes `$ARGUMENTS`, Then `/context-update` carries the user's focus text in the placeholder's place and the procedure around it is unchanged.
- [ ] Given the three commands have been injected, When their templates are inspected, Then each names the procedure it delegates to (bootstrap, incremental update, or review) and none carries an unsubstituted placeholder other than `/context-update`'s single `$ARGUMENTS`.
- [ ] Given the user's config already defines one of the three commands, When the config hook runs, Then that command is left byte-identical while the other two are still added.
- [ ] Given the commands are injected, When each one's target agent is resolved against the same config object, Then all three resolve to an agent that actually exists there — a command must never point at a missing agent.

## Coverage

Every story below has at least one behavioural test in `tests/stories/`, and
`tests/stories/coverage.test.mjs` enforces that mechanically in both directions:
it fails if a story here has no test, and it fails if a test names a story this

The nine suites under `tests/` are unit-style and are kept as they are; the
`tests/stories/` suites are the behavioural layer, written one epic per file with
every test name carrying its story id. Run everything with `npm test`.

**No story is uncovered.** The previously uncovered set — US-1, US-2, US-3,
US-6, and all of epic F — now has tests, and the coverage guard fails the build
if any of them loses one.
